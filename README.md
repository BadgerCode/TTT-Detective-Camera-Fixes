_Fixes for the [TTT Detective Camera](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=742075110)_

# Fixes
* Lua errors when you get the weapon out


# TODO
* Fix flashlight pointing in the wrong direction when the camera is active
    * _This is because it hooks into ShouldDrawLocalPlayer_
* Is the camera too difficult to see?
* Pitching the camera is initially a bit difficult
* The camera interference effect doesn't disappear when you pick it up


# Feedback
* Can it be seen in the TTT damage log
