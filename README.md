_Fixes for the [TTT Detective Camera](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=742075110)_

# Fixes
* Lua errors when you get the weapon out
* Better animation
* Fixes interference not disappearing when you pick the camera up
* Improves hint text (MOUSE1 to place; better contrast and text)


# TODO
* Fix flashlight pointing in the wrong direction when the camera is active
    * _This is because it hooks into ShouldDrawLocalPlayer_
* Is the camera too difficult to see?
* Pitching the camera is initially a bit difficult
