_Fixes for the [TTT Detective Camera](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=742075110)_

# Fixes
* Lua errors when you get the weapon out


# TODO
* Fix flashlight pointing in the wrong direction when the camera is active
* Is the camera too difficult to see?


# Feedback
* When you place it (not holstered) you instantly shoot/hit (which could cause you to break it straight away)
* When you pick it up, you can't re-place it
* Can it be seen in the TTT damage log
